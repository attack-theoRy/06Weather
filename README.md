API: OpenWeatherMap

What this App Does:
Weather app that allows you to find the current weather conditions by city. Has search bar (where user inputs city) that calls openweathermap api to get 
current temperature, humidity, date, wind speed and UV index. UV index is color coded to denote whether UV is favorable (green), moderate (yellow) or severe (red). Favorable = 0-3, Moderate = 3-5 and Severe = 5+. The app also gives a 5 day forecast for the city with basic weather conditions including a small image to denote whether it will be sunny, rainy, foggy etc. and then adds the city to a search history that is displayed beneath the search bar.  This search history is saved to localstorage and retrieved when opening / refreshing the browser.  This search history is also 'clickable' if you would like to search for the same city again. After building up a search history, the browser will open up to the results of the last city searched.
